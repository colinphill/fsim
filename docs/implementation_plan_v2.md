# fsim v2 implementation plan

This is the authoritative batch and status record for fsim v2. The v1 release
is preserved by annotated tag `v1.0.0` at `6450599`; v2 development starts on
`codex/v2` from post-v1 checkpoint `1462f18`.

## Working cadence

- Every v2 implementation batch contains exactly 20 numbered changes.
- Changes 1 through 19 accumulate in one recoverable worktree with focused
  warnings-as-errors builds and targeted tests.
- Change 20 owns the full exact-LLVM Debug and Release regressions,
  documentation, one commit, and one push.
- Local builds use at least eight workers.
- Sanitizers run only immediately before committing a scheduled CI-monitoring
  batch. Ordinary batches do not configure, build, or run sanitizer targets.
- Every tenth numbered batch is a non-documentation CI-monitoring boundary;
  Batch 140 is the next boundary. Documentation-only runs are not monitored.

## Batch 133 - automatic cross-language resolution - Complete

1. **Complete.** Tag v1.0.0, create and publish `codex/v2`, and establish the
   v2 plan/resume records and 20-change cadence.
2. **Complete.** Advance manifests to schema 2 and make binding targets
   optional in the project and elaboration APIs.
3. **Complete.** Add schema-1-to-schema-2 migration support, an actionable
   schema rejection, and the `fsim migrate --to 2` command surface.
4. **Complete.** Introduce the central immutable unit-candidate lookup and
   resolution-result model instead of first-match selection.
5. **Complete.** Define canonical identities and target-language case rules
   for VHDL, Verilog/SystemVerilog, and SystemC candidates.
6. **Complete.** Group project-built SystemC factory indexes by logical source
   library and reject same-library public-name duplicates.
7. **Complete.** Record the stringized `SC_FSIM_HDL_MODULE(Type)` proxy type as
   its inferred implementation name without adding hierarchy.
8. **Complete.** Route unqualified tops through the common resolver with
   `work` as their parent library while retaining qualified tops.
9. **Complete.** Replace same-language and first-match hierarchy target
   selection with deterministic candidate selection.
10. **Complete.** Infer VHDL children beneath Verilog/SystemVerilog parents.
11. **Complete.** Infer Verilog/SystemVerilog children beneath VHDL
    components after component-declaration visibility checks.
12. **Complete.** Infer SystemC exported factories beneath HDL parents.
13. **Complete.** Infer VHDL and Verilog/SystemVerilog implementations beneath
    SystemC HDL proxies.
14. **Complete.** Preserve explicit target overrides and admit
    resolver-only bindings for inferred cross-language inout instances.
15. **Complete.** Replace explicit-binding-required failures with
    deterministic missing-target diagnostics.
16. **Complete.** Diagnose same-library ambiguity across languages and
    duplicate candidate identities in deterministic order.
17. **Complete.** Reject inferred VHDL entities with multiple eligible
    architectures unless configuration or an explicit target selects one.
18. **Complete.** Validate interfaces only after unique resolution and include
    selected identities in native/cache provenance.
19. **Complete.** Migrate representative fixtures and the three-language
    example while retaining explicit override and legacy coverage.
20. **Complete.** Update public and release records and run the exact-LLVM
    Debug and Release regressions plus source, catalog, inventory, and release
    gates. Debug passed 106/106 tests in 129.35 seconds and Release passed
    106/106 tests in 99.88 seconds. The accumulated batch is committed and
    pushed once, without a sanitizer run or CI monitoring because Batch 133 is
    not a scheduled CI boundary.

## Forward priority order

1. **Batch 134:** configurable parent-plus-library search, CLI overrides,
   lazy mapping, complete-scope ambiguity, and unavailable-library-on-use
   diagnostics.
2. Multiple aliased top-level roots in one simulation.
3. Read-only out-of-tree `.fsimlib` directory mappings.
4. Explicit non-project compile, elaborate, and simulate artifact phases.
5. Separate incremental SystemC compilation and linking.
6. Complete VHDL-2008/VITAL, Verilog-2005, SystemVerilog-2017 classes/UVM,
   VPI, DPI, and VHPI.
7. Older VHDL, Verilog, and SystemVerilog standard modes.
8. Full SDF annotation with 2.1/3.0 compatibility and VITAL integration.
9. FST tracing for every value exposed through the trace model.
10. Cross-platform artifact, migration, conformance, debugger, trace, and
    documentation closure before declaring v2.0.
