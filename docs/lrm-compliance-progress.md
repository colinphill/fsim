# LRM compliance progress

Goal (owner, 2026-10-08): close every language-compliance gap needed to run
the public compliance corpora unmodified, apart from simulator-specific hooks.
Design notes: [lrm-compliance-notes.md](lrm-compliance-notes.md).

## Corpora and runner

The corpora are kept outside the repository, under
`.local-artifacts/lrm-corpora/sources`:

| Suite | Source | License | Pass/fail convention |
|---|---|---|---|
| sv-tests | chipsalliance/sv-tests | ISC | exit status against `:should_fail_because:`, plus each `:assert:` line |
| verilator | Verilator `test_regress` 'simulator' scenario tests | CC0 test files | generated clock shell; `*-* All Finished *-*` |
| ivtest | Icarus `ivtest` regress lists | GPL-2.0 | `PASSED` line or gold output; CE/RE expect errors |
| vests | GHDL `testsuite/vests` (VHDL-93) | GPL-2.0 | no error-severity assertion; output files compared |
| nvc | nvc `test/regress` | GPL-3.0 | normal/fail/gold kinds |
| vhdl-compliance | VHDL/Compliance-Tests (VUnit) | Apache-2.0 | per-test results through the VUnit stand-in |

UVM-tagged sv-tests compile the Accellera UVM trees named in
[uvm-source-provenance.md](uvm-source-provenance.md), under
`.local-artifacts/lrm-corpora/uvm`.

Run the corpora with:

    python3 scripts/lrm_corpus.py run [--suite S] [--filter RE] -j 10 --out DIR
    python3 scripts/lrm_corpus.py compare BEFORE/results.jsonl AFTER/results.jsonl

The runner supplies only simulator-specific hooks:

- top selection;
- generic overrides;
- plusargs;
- the Verilator clock shell;
- `scripts/lrm_corpus/vunit_shim.vhd`, which stands in for the VUnit library.

## Baseline (2026-10-08, interpreter)

Harness revision before the UVM, assert-evaluator and Verilator-shell fixes.
VESTs was interrupted by the parser hang described below.

| Suite | Cases | Pass | Fail | Timeout | Skip | Pass rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| sv-tests | 1497 | 908 | 584 | 5 | 0 | 60.7% |
| verilator | 2415 | 172 | 1941 | 6 | 296 | 8.1% |
| ivtest | 2826 | 1170 | 1628 | 3 | 25 | 41.8% |
| vests (partial) | 2406 | 831 | 1409 | 166 | 0 | 34.5% |

## Fix log

### Batch 1

SystemVerilog and Verilog:

- `$time`, `$stime` and `$realtime` failed with error 10 in any unit without
  a timescale. They now use the project resolution, as the unit's delays do.
  - Before: 386 Verilator and 50 ivtest cases failed this way.
- A whole-signal port actual of a different packed width was rejected. It
  now connects through an adapter that zero-extends or truncates, as a
  continuous assignment does (IEEE 1800-2017 §23.3.3).
  - Before: 278 ivtest cases failed this way.
- `` `begin_keywords``, `` `end_keywords`` and `` `pragma`` are accepted in
  Verilog-2005 (IEEE 1364-2005 §19.10–19.11).
- The scalar `Convert` operation can return an integral result (used by
  VHDL `integer(r)`, rounding to nearest, ties away from zero).

VHDL types:

- Integer and floating type declarations (`type t is range ...`) sent the
  parser into an endless error loop until memory ran out.
  - They now declare INTEGER- or REAL-based types; the physical-unit loop
    recovers from malformed units.
  - Before: VESTs compile timeouts.
- Arrays may be indexed by any discrete type mark: `array (E)`,
  `array (E range <>)` and `array (E range L to R)`. Aggregates accept BOOLEAN
  and character-literal choices.
- REAL:
  - Arithmetic, comparison, negation and `abs` ran on raw bit patterns. They
    now use the IEEE real scalar operations.
  - `real` signals failed to elaborate.
  - `integer(r)`/`real(i)` were rejected.
  - Real-literal actuals could not match REAL formals in overload
    resolution.

VHDL strings, subprograms and STD.ENV:

- Runtime `T'IMAGE(X)` was missing entirely (`report integer'image(n)`
  failed). So were `TO_STRING`/`TO_HSTRING`/`TO_OSTRING` of runtime values.
  - Now implemented for integer, enumeration, BOOLEAN, BIT, STD_ULOGIC,
    CHARACTER, REAL, and bit or logic vectors.
  - TIME images are still pending.
- Subprograms:
  - Functions may contain `report`/`assert`.
  - Procedures may contain `report`/`assert` and signal assignments.
  - Formals and results may be constrained arrays, TIME or REAL.
  - Procedures accept signal-class formals, which denote the actual signal.
- Procedures declared in a process can read and write the process's
  variables.
- Wrong-result fix: a procedure's frame captured the first call's constant
  actuals, so `p(3); p(5)` ran `p(3)` twice.
- STRING procedure formals (mode `in`), with string and real formals taking
  part in procedure overload resolution.
- `now` (STD.STANDARD.NOW) was not implemented. It now returns the current
  time.
- The final `else` of a conditional signal assignment is optional.
- Loops over a type mark (`for d in T loop`, `for i in T range L to R loop`)
  are supported. Generates also accept a type mark or `x'range`.
- `std.env.stop`, `finish` and `resolution_limit` are accepted in VHDL-2008.
  - Still needed: the VHDL-2008 `use std.env.all` form, which requires a
    VHDL-2008 STD.ENV package.

Regression fixtures: `tests/fixtures/compliance/`. They run on both engines,
and their expected values were checked against xsim.

### Corpus run 2 (after batch 1, interpreter)

| Suite | Cases | Pass | Fail | Timeout | Skip | Pass rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| sv-tests | 1497 | 988 | 504 | 5 | 0 | 66.0% |
| verilator | 2415 | 397 | 1715 | 7 | 296 | 18.7% |
| ivtest | 2826 | 1198 | 1600 | 3 | 25 | 42.8% |
| vests | 3665 | 1710 | 1953 | 2 | 0 | 46.7% |
| nvc | 1482 | 412 | 852 | 3 | 215 | 32.5% |
| vhdl-compliance | 72 | 0 | 72 | 0 | 0 | 0.0% |

### Batch 2

- A protected type body following its declaration in the same region was
  reported as a duplicate type.
- `fork ... join_none` in functions is accepted from SystemVerilog-2009
  (IEEE 1800-2009 13.4.4); lowering in subprogram bodies is pending.
- VHDL ports of every mode accept a default; using it as the driver's
  initial value is pending.
- Enumeration values index arrays (validation).
- `rising_edge`/`falling_edge` lower as boolean expressions, including on
  signal-class formals and with `else` branches.
- `wait for` accepts a runtime TIME value.
- Functions called without an actual parameter part (`return do_it;`).
- SystemVerilog hierarchical references resolve below the current instance,
  below each ancestor, from the top-level modules, and through `$root`, for
  both reads and writes. A process naming an instance that does not exist yet
  is lowered again after the unit's children are instantiated, and such
  processes are never cached as templates. Still pending: event controls on
  hierarchical names, continuous assignments, and generate-scope processes.
- `fork ... join_none` in functions also lowers from SystemVerilog-2009.
- FSIM-ELAB-HIR-001 "could not be lowered" reports now name the innermost
  unsupported expression; `lrm_corpus.py run --rerun-from --rerun-code`
  re-runs selected failures.
