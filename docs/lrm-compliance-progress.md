# LRM compliance progress

Goal (owner, 2026-10-08): close every language-compliance gap needed to run
the public compliance corpora unmodified, apart from simulator-specific hooks.
Design notes: [lrm-compliance-notes.md](lrm-compliance-notes.md).

## Corpora and runner

The corpora are kept outside the repository, under
`.local-artifacts/lrm-corpora/sources`:

| Suite | Source | License | Pass/fail convention |
|---|---|---|---|
| sv-tests | chipsalliance/sv-tests | ISC | exit status against `:should_fail_because:`, plus each `:assert:` line |
| verilator | Verilator `test_regress` 'simulator' scenario tests | CC0 test files | generated clock shell; `*-* All Finished *-*` |
| ivtest | Icarus `ivtest` regress lists | GPL-2.0 | `PASSED` line or gold output; CE/RE expect errors |
| vests | GHDL `testsuite/vests` (VHDL-93) | GPL-2.0 | no error-severity assertion; output files compared |
| nvc | nvc `test/regress` | GPL-3.0 | normal/fail/gold kinds |
| vhdl-compliance | VHDL/Compliance-Tests (VUnit) | Apache-2.0 | per-test results through the VUnit stand-in |

UVM-tagged sv-tests compile the Accellera UVM trees named in
[uvm-source-provenance.md](uvm-source-provenance.md), under
`.local-artifacts/lrm-corpora/uvm`.

Run the corpora with:

    python3 scripts/lrm_corpus.py run [--suite S] [--filter RE] -j 10 --out DIR
    python3 scripts/lrm_corpus.py compare BEFORE/results.jsonl AFTER/results.jsonl

The runner supplies only simulator-specific hooks:

- top selection;
- generic overrides;
- plusargs;
- the Verilator clock shell;
- `scripts/lrm_corpus/vunit_shim.vhd`, which stands in for the VUnit library.

## Baseline (2026-10-08, interpreter)

Harness revision before the UVM, assert-evaluator and Verilator-shell fixes.
VESTs was interrupted by the parser hang described below.

| Suite | Cases | Pass | Fail | Timeout | Skip | Pass rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| sv-tests | 1497 | 908 | 584 | 5 | 0 | 60.7% |
| verilator | 2415 | 172 | 1941 | 6 | 296 | 8.1% |
| ivtest | 2826 | 1170 | 1628 | 3 | 25 | 41.8% |
| vests (partial) | 2406 | 831 | 1409 | 166 | 0 | 34.5% |

## Fix log

### Batch 1

SystemVerilog and Verilog:

- `$time`, `$stime` and `$realtime` failed with error 10 in any unit without
  a timescale. They now use the project resolution, as the unit's delays do.
  - Before: 386 Verilator and 50 ivtest cases failed this way.
- A whole-signal port actual of a different packed width was rejected. It
  now connects through an adapter that zero-extends or truncates, as a
  continuous assignment does (IEEE 1800-2017 §23.3.3).
  - Before: 278 ivtest cases failed this way.
- `` `begin_keywords``, `` `end_keywords`` and `` `pragma`` are accepted in
  Verilog-2005 (IEEE 1364-2005 §19.10–19.11).
- The scalar `Convert` operation can return an integral result (used by
  VHDL `integer(r)`, rounding to nearest, ties away from zero).

VHDL types:

- Integer and floating type declarations (`type t is range ...`) sent the
  parser into an endless error loop until memory ran out.
  - They now declare INTEGER- or REAL-based types; the physical-unit loop
    recovers from malformed units.
  - Before: VESTs compile timeouts.
- Arrays may be indexed by any discrete type mark: `array (E)`,
  `array (E range <>)` and `array (E range L to R)`. Aggregates accept BOOLEAN
  and character-literal choices.
- REAL:
  - Arithmetic, comparison, negation and `abs` ran on raw bit patterns. They
    now use the IEEE real scalar operations.
  - `real` signals failed to elaborate.
  - `integer(r)`/`real(i)` were rejected.
  - Real-literal actuals could not match REAL formals in overload
    resolution.

VHDL strings, subprograms and STD.ENV:

- Runtime `T'IMAGE(X)` was missing entirely (`report integer'image(n)`
  failed). So were `TO_STRING`/`TO_HSTRING`/`TO_OSTRING` of runtime values.
  - Now implemented for integer, enumeration, BOOLEAN, BIT, STD_ULOGIC,
    CHARACTER, REAL, and bit or logic vectors.
  - TIME images are still pending.
- Subprograms:
  - Functions may contain `report`/`assert`.
  - Procedures may contain `report`/`assert` and signal assignments.
  - Formals and results may be constrained arrays, TIME or REAL.
  - Procedures accept signal-class formals, which denote the actual signal.
- Procedures declared in a process can read and write the process's
  variables.
- Wrong-result fix: a procedure's frame captured the first call's constant
  actuals, so `p(3); p(5)` ran `p(3)` twice.
- STRING procedure formals (mode `in`), with string and real formals taking
  part in procedure overload resolution.
- `now` (STD.STANDARD.NOW) was not implemented. It now returns the current
  time.
- The final `else` of a conditional signal assignment is optional.
- Loops over a type mark (`for d in T loop`, `for i in T range L to R loop`)
  are supported. Generates also accept a type mark or `x'range`.
- `std.env.stop`, `finish` and `resolution_limit` are accepted in VHDL-2008.
  - Still needed: the VHDL-2008 `use std.env.all` form, which requires a
    VHDL-2008 STD.ENV package.

Regression fixtures: `tests/fixtures/compliance/`. They run on both engines,
and their expected values were checked against xsim.

### Corpus run 2 (after batch 1, interpreter)

| Suite | Cases | Pass | Fail | Timeout | Skip | Pass rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| sv-tests | 1497 | 988 | 504 | 5 | 0 | 66.0% |
| verilator | 2415 | 397 | 1715 | 7 | 296 | 18.7% |
| ivtest | 2826 | 1198 | 1600 | 3 | 25 | 42.8% |
| vests | 3665 | 1710 | 1953 | 2 | 0 | 46.7% |
| nvc | 1482 | 412 | 852 | 3 | 215 | 32.5% |
| vhdl-compliance | 72 | 0 | 72 | 0 | 0 | 0.0% |

### Batch 2

- A protected type body following its declaration in the same region was
  reported as a duplicate type.
- `fork ... join_none` in functions is accepted from SystemVerilog-2009
  (IEEE 1800-2009 13.4.4); lowering in subprogram bodies is pending.
- VHDL ports of every mode accept a default; using it as the driver's
  initial value is pending.
- Enumeration values index arrays (validation).
- `rising_edge`/`falling_edge` lower as boolean expressions, including on
  signal-class formals and with `else` branches.
- `wait for` accepts a runtime TIME value.
- Functions called without an actual parameter part (`return do_it;`).
- SystemVerilog hierarchical references resolve below the current instance,
  below each ancestor, from the top-level modules, and through `$root`, for
  both reads and writes. A process naming an instance that does not exist yet
  is lowered again after the unit's children are instantiated, and such
  processes are never cached as templates. Still pending: event controls on
  hierarchical names, continuous assignments, and generate-scope processes.
- `fork ... join_none` in functions also lowers from SystemVerilog-2009.
- FSIM-ELAB-HIR-001 "could not be lowered" reports now name the innermost
  unsupported expression; `lrm_corpus.py run --rerun-from --rerun-code`
  re-runs selected failures.

### Batch 3: enumeration-indexed arrays and composite constants

- Signals with composite initializers failed to elaborate unless the elements
  were single logic values. This covered arrays of vectors, integers,
  enumerations and records, multidimensional arrays, enumeration indices,
  and range or OTHERS choices. They are now evaluated statically.
- Composite constants whose elements are not single logic values could not
  be read in processes (`constant rom : rom_t := ...; x := rom(i);` failed).
  Constants in architectures are materialized as read-only signals. Constants
  in non-generic packages are materialized on first use, so dynamic indexing
  works too.
- Enumeration-typed index expressions (`arr(sel)` with `sel` an enumeration
  signal or variable) are accepted for reads and writes, including record
  fields of selected elements and multidimensional selections.
- BOOLEAN, BIT, CHARACTER, SEVERITY_LEVEL and STD_ULOGIC type marks give
  static index ranges (`array (e_t, boolean) of natural`).
- `T'POS(d)` and other enumeration attributes accept a for-loop parameter
  that iterates over `T`, either directly or through an array's
  `'RANGE`/`'REVERSE_RANGE`.
- Based and exponent integer literals (`16#A0#`, `1E3`) lower at run time.

Fixtures: `vhdl_enum_index_arrays.vhd`, `vhdl_composite_constants.vhd`.
Both were checked against xsim.

### Batch 4: range constraints, interface ranges, re-analysis

VHDL:

- Index and range constraints accept range attributes (`x'range`,
  `x'reverse_range`), discrete subtype names (`mem_t(idx_t)`) and
  `T range L to R`. The direction follows the evaluated bounds.
  - Before: 125 nvc/VESTs cases failed with `FSIM-VHDL-PARSE-009`.
- Array attributes of unconstrained subprogram formals and ports
  (`vec'range`, `vec'length`) were rejected outright. Locals sized from them
  (`variable r : bit_vector(vec'range)`) now get their bounds per call frame.
- An element subtype constrained with non-literal bounds
  (`bit_vector(0 to N-1)`) is no longer treated as unconstrained and gated to
  VHDL-2008.
- Re-analysis replaces a library unit (IEEE 1076-1993 11.4, 1076-2008 13.5),
  even when another design file defined it.
  - The secondary units of a replaced primary unit, and catalog objects that
    depend on a replaced unit, become obsolete.
  - Before: 104 VESTs cases failed with `FSIM-SEM-0003` or `FSIM-WS-001`
    unit collisions.
- The reserved word `component` may precede the unit name in a component
  instantiation (VHDL-93 9.6).
- Incorrect VHDL-2008 gates removed:
  - A function-call result may be indexed, sliced or element-selected in
    every revision (VHDL-93 6.1, 6.3).
  - The names `boolean_vector`, `integer_vector`, `real_vector` and
    `time_vector` are free for user types before VHDL-2008.
  - Before: 84 VESTs cases failed with `FSIM-FE-VHSTD-003`.

SystemVerilog:

- A streaming concatenation is accepted as an assignment target (unpack) from
  SystemVerilog-2005. It had been gated to 2023.

Test harness: a compliance fixture header may name `before=<file>`, a source
compiled into the same library first. Fixtures:

- `vhdl_range_constraints.vhd`
- `vhdl_reanalysis.vhd` (with `vhdl_reanalysis_first.vhd.in`)
- `sv_streaming_unpack.sv`

All were checked against xsim.

Accepting these constraint forms exposes missing analysis-time legality
checks in about 33 VESTs negative tests. They had been rejected only by the
constraint parse error:

- index-constraint bounds outside the index subtype;
- slices of multidimensional arrays;
- labels and other non-object names used as primaries.

### Batch 5: compilation-unit declarations

- Compilation-unit (`$unit`) parameters, local parameters, typedefs,
  variables, `let`, events, functions and tasks (IEEE 1800-2017 3.12.1) are
  collected in a synthetic package per design file (`fsim_unit_<hash>`).
  Later design units of the compilation unit import it.
  - Before, `typedef` and `let` there were silently skipped, functions were
    rejected as unqualified class methods, and parameters and variables
    failed with `FSIM-SV-UNSUPPORTED-001` (218 cases).
- Forward type declarations (`typedef struct name;`, `typedef name;`,
  IEEE 1800-2017 6.18).
- `rand`/`randc` members of unpacked structures parse. An aggregate member
  the parser cannot read no longer loops forever.
- Member selection (`p.hi`) on a variable whose structure type comes from
  another unit, such as a package typedef or `$unit`, now resolves. Such
  type references keep only their spelling across object linking.

Fixture: `sv_compilation_unit_declarations.sv`, checked against xsim.
Targeted rerun of the 218 cases: 63 now pass. Most of the rest fail later
on other gaps:

- package parameter defaults (`FSIM-ELAB-SVPKG-006`);
- non-ANSI port forms;
- randomization.

### Batch 18: enumerations, real values, classes in modules, formats

Fixtures: `sv_enum_methods.sv`, `sv_type_and_class_forms.sv` (both pass on
xsim).

Enumerations (6.19):
- `first`, `last`, `next(N)`, `prev(N)`, `num` and `name`, with or without
  parentheses. Anonymous enumerations get a hidden typedef (`$enum:<first
  literal>`) so their methods and literal names resolve as for a typedef.
- Literal ranges `name[N]` and `name[N:M]` (6.19.2), and a type-name base
  with a packed dimension (`enum T [7:0]`).
- Base types must be integer atoms or vectors with at most one packed
  dimension (`SVENUM-004`). x/z values need a 4-state base, and the literal
  after one needs its own initializer (`SVENUM-005`). Values must be
  constant (`SVENUM-006`). A sized literal must have the base size.
- An integral variable, array element or function result assigned to an
  enumeration needs a cast, and so do enumeration array elements.
  Equality of two different enumeration or packed types is an integral
  comparison (11.4.5), as xsim accepts it.
- Enumeration literals declared in a class are class constants (8.23).

Real values (6.12.2, 6.24.1, 11.3.1):
- An integral value assigned to a real converts its value (it was a bit
  copy, so `r = i` gave 0), and a real assigned to an integral rounds half
  away from zero.
- `real'`, `shortreal'` and `realtime'` casts, and integral casts of real
  operands.
- An integral operand of a real operation converts. A binary operation or
  conditional with a real operand is real, as is an element of a real
  array or an untyped parameter with a real value.

Formats (21.2.1.3):
- `%e`/`%f`/`%g` take a precision (`%8.3f`) and default to six digits, as
  in C and xsim. Before, the default was 17 significant digits, and a
  precision was a parse error.
- A real conversion of an integral value converts it, in `$display`,
  `$fwrite` and `$sformatf`.

Classes:
- A class declared in a module: its properties shadow module names, so
  property writes reach the object. Its method bodies no longer create
  implicit nets in the module. A constructor no longer reports an unknown
  `constructor` type. Compound updates of class properties (`a += v`) lower
  in task bodies.
- The class executor evaluates class constants and enumeration literals.

Declarations and ports:
- `$bits` of a built-in data type (`$bits(int)`, `$bits(logic [7:0])`)
  folds to its width; a typedef name used as an operand is not an implicit
  net.
- Packed arrays of named vector types (`typedef T [3:0] U`, `T [2:0] v`).
- Non-ANSI ports and classic task arguments: `int x; output x;` in either
  order; the redeclaration checks of 23.2.2.1 and 13.3 (`SV-SEM-396`);
  `input wire T x` with a typedef.
- A SystemVerilog system service in a Verilog mode (`$bits` under
  Verilog-2005) is a warning (`SV-PARSE-350`), since IEEE 1364 leaves
  additional system services to the implementation, as iverilog does.

Runtime and runner:
- `$fopen` returns zero when it cannot open a file (21.3.1) instead of
  stopping the run.
- Runner: ivtest and Verilator expected compile failures may be rejected by
  `elaborate` (both tools' compile steps elaborate). ivtest cases run with
  `--file-root .`, a `work/` directory, and copies of the data files their
  sources name.

Corpus effect (interpreter): sv-tests +16 (1114/1497), ivtest +288
(1626/2801), Verilator +18 (703/2119), nvc +13 (465/1267), VESTs +53
(2030/3665). One ivtest port-range case, and two others that newly
completed, now expect what xsim and Verilator accept (see
`lrm-compliance-notes.md`).

### Batch 17: operand signedness, port data types, parameter values

These were wrong values from Verilator `$stop` triage. Each was checked
against xsim. Fixture: `sv_operand_signedness.sv`.

- An operation is signed only when all of its context-determined operands
  are, and those operands extend by the operation's signedness (11.8.1,
  11.8.2). Before, operands extended by their own signedness, so
  `u8 + s4` sign-extended `s4`. The flag also reaches nested operators,
  shifts, unary operators and comparisons. The base of `**` keeps its own
  signedness, because the exponent is self-determined.
- A port read through its connected actual keeps the port's declared
  signedness, including a `wire signed` redeclaration of a non-ANSI port.
- `int i; output i;`: a port direction declared after the data declaration
  forms one port of that type (23.2.2.1). Before, it formed a 1-bit port plus
  a separate signal, which also broke positional connections.
- A value parameter with an explicit type or range is no longer an alias of
  a name default or actual: `parameter [3:0] P = Q` has width 4 (6.20.2).
- A leftmost x or z digit fills the remaining bits of an elaboration-time
  based literal (`2'b?` is `zz`, 5.7.1). Untyped parameters with x/z values
  keep their literal width.
- `$bits` of a struct member is the member's width.
- An unassigned 4-state function result is x, both at run time and in
  constant evaluation (13.4.1, Table 6-7).
- `module automatic` / `package automatic` make tasks and functions
  automatic by default (6.21).
- A multi-character string literal in a packed context is eight bits per
  character (5.9).
- `$dist_uniform` with `start >= end` returns `start` without reading the
  seed, even when the seed is x (Annex N).
- Runner: a Verilator test whose compile fails only under Verilator
  (`fails=test.vlt_all`) may end at its unconditional `$stop`.

Triage of the remaining Verilator stops (2-state expectations, scheduling
races, Verilator-only flags) is in `lrm-compliance-notes.md`.

Corpus effect (interpreter, no case newly fails): sv-tests +8 (1098/1497),
ivtest +33 (1339/2801), Verilator +32 over runs 21 and 22 (685/2119).

### Batch 16: $stop reporting and Verilator driver fidelity

- `fsim simulate` prints `$stop paused the simulation` after the status line
  when a run ends at `$stop` rather than `$finish`. `$stop` suspends a
  simulation (IEEE 1800-2017 20.2), and before this the two endings were
  indistinguishable in batch output.
- Runner: a Verilator test passes when its run neither stops at `$stop` nor
  reports `%Error`. `*-* All Finished *-*` is required only when the test
  calls `test.execute(check_finished=True)`, as in `driver.py`. Before,
  every executing test needed the marker. That failed tests that finish
  without printing it, while a `$stop` after the marker went unnoticed.

Corpus effect: Verilator 29.4% to 31.4% (43 newly pass, none newly fail).

### Batch 15: extension by source signedness, cast widths, enum literals

These were wrong values, not unsupported constructs; Verilator checksum tests
stopped on them.

- A value extends to its target's width by its own signedness, which its
  operands determine (IEEE 1800-2017 11.8.2). Before, assignments and
  task/function arguments sign-extended by the target's signedness:
  `s = 3'b111` into a signed byte gave `8'hff` instead of `8'h07`, and
  `u = 3'sb111` into an unsigned byte gave `8'h07` instead of `8'hff`.
- Unary `-`, `~` and `+` widen their operand to the context width before
  applying (11.6.1). `-8'sh80` into a 16-bit target is `16'h0080`. Before,
  this was right only because extension had wrongly followed the unsigned
  target.
- A size or type cast evaluates its operand in the cast's width (6.24.1):
  `byte_t'(one << 2)` is `8'b100`.
- A constant `if` condition whose arithmetic uses sized literals is no
  longer folded by the host-integer constant evaluator.
  `(4'd15 + 4'd1) != 4'd0` is false. The runtime path applies Verilog
  widths.
- An enumeration literal has its enumeration's width even when its value is
  an unsized integer (`P = 0` in `enum logic [2:0]` is 3 bits, 6.19). HIR
  normalization no longer folds enumeration-literal references into untyped
  literals.
- `FSIM-ELAB-SVTYPE-004` now also rejects a compound assignment or
  increment of an enumeration variable (6.19.4).

Corpus effect (against batch 14): Verilator +5, ivtest +23, sv-tests +4,
no regressions.

Fixture: `sv_expression_widths.sv`, checked against xsim.

### Batch 14: multidimensional packed arrays, parameter typing, %-d

- Selections of multidimensional packed arrays (`logic [3:0][7:0] w`) were
  wrong. `w[2]`, `w[2:1]`, `w[3-:2]` and `w[i]` selected bits of the
  flattened vector instead of whole elements, so reads returned wrong values
  and dynamic writes failed to lower. The HIR now keeps every packed
  dimension (`sv::TypeReference::packed_dimensions`). An element select has
  the width of the remaining dimensions, and outer-dimension selects are
  scaled by the element width (IEEE 1800-2017 7.4.5).
  - Covered: constant and dynamic indices; nested selects (`w[1][3:0]`);
    blocking, nonblocking and continuous writes.
  - A dynamic element read with an unknown or out-of-range index yields X.
  - Several Verilator CRC/checksum tests had stopped on mismatches caused by
    this.
- `%-d` (left-justify flag without a width) prints the minimal decimal, as
  other simulators do. It had been rejected as an invalid format.
- Runner: a Verilator test that never calls `test.execute()` is compiled
  and elaborated but not simulated, as `driver.py` does. Requiring
  `*-* All Finished *-*` from such tests was a runner artifact.

- Parameter typing (IEEE 1800-2017 6.20.2):
  - A value parameter without a type or range takes the width and
    signedness of its value (`parameter Q = 3'd5` is 3-bit unsigned, not a
    signed 32-bit integer). `$bits` agrees.
  - A local parameter with a type or range keeps it. HIR normalization had
    folded `localparam [7:0] L = 300` into the unsized literal 300. Such
    references now stay names, and the lowerer converts the value (44).
    `int` and `integer` local parameters whose value fits still fold.
  - Dynamic element writes use the part-select write operations, which the
    LLVM engine requires for writes wider than one bit.
  - An unsized based literal (`'b1`) is 32 bits wide; an unbased unsized
    literal (`'1`) is one bit when self-determined.
- Assignment-pattern member values convert to the member width (10.9.2).
- A packed structure or union may be compared for equality with an untyped
  integral value (7.2.1). `FSIM-ELAB-SVTYPE-005` had rejected
  `s != 6'b110011`.

Corpus effect: Verilator 26.5% to 29.2% (58 newly pass, none newly fail);
ivtest 13 newly pass; sv-tests unchanged.

Fixtures: `sv_packed_multidim.sv` and `sv_parameter_types.sv`, both checked
against xsim.

### Batch 13: formal subelements, aggregate slices, module items

- Individual association of formal subelements in port maps (IEEE 1076-1993
  4.3.2.2, 1076-2008 6.5.7.1): `d(7) => x, d(6 downto 0) => y` and
  `p.field => z`. The parser combines the parts of one formal into a single
  association. Its actual is an aggregate with the subelements as choices,
  which is accepted before VHDL-2008 when every part is a name. Input ports
  only so far.
- An aggregate range choice whose value is an array supplies a slice
  (`(7 => x, 6 downto 0 => y)`, IEEE 1076-2008 9.3.3.3).
- SystemVerilog modules accept `const` variables (6.20.6), `var`
  declarations with an implicit logic type (6.8), and empty `;` items
  (A.1.10).
- New check `FSIM-SV-SEM-395`: a Verilog (not SystemVerilog) ANSI task or
  function port declaration must name its direction. ivtest br1027c and
  br1027e expect this rejection in Verilog mode. Batch 12 had made them
  pass by accident.

Corpus effect against run 6: VESTs, nvc and VHDL-Compliance gain 8 cases;
ivtest gains 2. Of the 120 `FSIM-VHDL-PARSE-042` cases, most now stop at
other gaps. The largest is a conversion function on the formal side
(`to_x(formal) => actual`, 36 VESTs cases), which the parser cannot yet
tell apart from an indexed formal.

- Runner: VESTs `OUTPUT=` files are no longer compared with the provided
  iofiles. GHDL's own harness (`testsuite.sh`) records them but never
  compares them. The iofiles are inputs for the read tests, and a typed
  file's representation is implementation defined. 53 run-6 "output file
  differs" failures were artifacts of this stricter check.

Fixtures: `vhdl_formal_subelements.vhd` and `sv_module_items.sv`, both
checked against xsim.

### Corpus run 6 (after batches 10 to 12, interpreter)

| Suite | Cases | Pass | Fail | Timeout | Skip | Pass rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| sv-tests | 1497 | 1087 | 409 | 1 | 0 | 72.6% |
| verilator | 2415 | 562 | 1554 | 3 | 296 | 26.5% |
| ivtest | 2826 | 1268 | 1529 | 4 | 25 | 45.3% |
| vests | 3665 | 1974 | 1689 | 2 | 0 | 53.9% |
| nvc | 1482 | 451 | 813 | 3 | 215 | 35.6% |
| vhdl-compliance | 72 | 16 | 56 | 0 | 0 | 22.2% |

Compared with run 5, 177 cases newly pass and 4 newly fail. All 4 are
negative ivtest cases that newly supported syntax now reaches:
- br1027c and br1027e: fixed in batch 13.
- enum_base_fail_string2: an enum base that names a string typedef.
- sv_array_cassign_fail10: an enum array assigned to an integer array.

The last two need elaboration-time type checks (queued).

### Batch 12: display arguments, decimal field widths, shared file handles

- Display and write tasks accept empty arguments, which print a space
  (`$display(a,,b)`). A string literal after the first argument is a format
  for the arguments that follow (`$monitor($time,, "A=%b", a)`). IEEE
  1364-2005 17.1.1 / 1800-2017 21.2.1.
- A decimal value with no explicit field width (`%d`, or a default-format
  argument) is padded to the width of its largest magnitude (IEEE 1800-2017
  21.2.1.3). Examples: `logic [3:0]` prints ` 5`, `integer` prints
  `         42`, `time` prints 20 characters. This applies to `$display`,
  `$monitor`, `$strobe`, `$fdisplay`, `$sformatf` and constant arguments.
  `%0d` still prints the minimal form. Before, fsim never padded, so its
  output differed from every other simulator's. Two application tests had
  encoded the unpadded form and were updated. VHDL images are unchanged.
- A file descriptor opened by one process may be used and closed by
  another, and `$fflush()` flushes every open file (IEEE 1800-2017 21.3).
  Before, using another process's descriptor was a runtime error.

- `typedef string T[...]` (string-element containers, IEEE 1800-2017 6.18)
  and `num()` of an associative array (7.9.1).

Fixtures: `sv_display_arguments.sv` and `sv_string_containers.sv`, both
checked against xsim.

### Batch 11: package signals, declarative use clauses, generate configurations

- Package signals (IEEE 1076-2008 4.7, 6.4.2.3). Each is one design-wide
  object, bound like a package shared variable. Instances write it and read
  it, and processes can be sensitive to it.
- Use clauses in package, entity and architecture declarative regions
  (12.4). They are treated as part of the unit's context clause. Signal
  declarations in an entity declarative region (3.2.3).
- Block configurations of a for-generate may select a static discrete range
  (`for g(0 to 3)`, 3.4.2). Generate specifications may use package
  constants and `'LOW`/`'HIGH`/`'LEFT`/`'RIGHT` of scalar subtypes.
- A component declaration in a block hides the architecture's homograph.
  Directly visible components hide use-visible ones (12.3). Before, both
  were treated as overloads, and the instance matched neither.
- SEVERITY_LEVEL, FILE_OPEN_KIND and FILE_OPEN_STATUS objects: signals,
  ports, array elements, `'POS`, `'VAL`, `'IMAGE`, and initializers using
  their literals. `CHARACTER'VAL` also works now.
- A CHARACTER constant initialized with a logic-looking literal
  (`constant c : character := '0'`) has value 48. Batch 10 had made
  comparisons with `'0'` CHARACTER-typed without changing this.
- New legality checks exposed by the new syntax:
  - `FSIM-VHDL-SEM-115`: an entity statement part contains a non-passive
    statement.
  - `FSIM-FE-VHORDER-004` now also covers `use lib.unit;` naming something
    other than a primary unit.

Corpus effect (full VESTs, nvc and VHDL-Compliance suites): compared with
run 5, 101 cases newly pass and none newly fail. VESTs is at 53.7%.

Fixtures: `vhdl_package_signals.vhd` and `vhdl_generate_configuration.vhd`,
both checked against xsim.

### Batch 10: CHARACTER values, null concatenation, net data types

- CHARACTER values (IEEE 1076-2008 16.3):
  - graphic literals (`'A'`);
  - the non-graphic names `NUL` to `USP`, `DEL` and `C128` to `C159`;
  - logic-looking literals (`'0'`, `'X'`) whose context is CHARACTER: an
    assignment target, an initialized object, a comparison operand, a case
    selector, or a `CHARACTER'` attribute prefix. Without such a context they
    stay BIT or STD_ULOGIC values, so numeric_std `u + '1'` is unchanged.
  - CHARACTER as an attribute prefix (`'POS`, `'HIGH`, ...) and as a case
    selector.
- A null array operand of `&` contributes no elements (IEEE 1076-2008
  9.2.5). This affects 27 VESTs concatenation tests.
- SystemVerilog nets with an explicit 4-state data type (`wire logic [7:0]`,
  `wire integer`, IEEE 1800-2017 6.7.1), and the `vectored`/`scalared`
  keywords.
- New diagnostic `FSIM-SV-SEM-394`: a void function's `return` supplies a
  value (IEEE 1800-2017 13.4.1). Batch 8 had made the sv-tests negative case
  13.4.1--function-void-return pass by accident.
- The corpus runner's Verilator shell now follows the C++ main that Verilator's
  `driver.py` generates: `clk` toggles every 5 units after time 10 (109
  rising edges by time 1100), and only `clk` and `fastclk` are connected. The
  tests count cycles against that main. Before, the shell copied the
  driver's Verilog shell, which gives about 91 edges, so tests that wait for
  cycle 99 never finished. Its input scan also misread
  `input logic [95:0] i` as a port named `logic`.

Fixtures: `vhdl_character_type.vhd` and `sv_net_data_types.sv`, both checked
against xsim.

### Corpus run 5 (after batches 6 to 9 and the Verilator shell fix, interpreter)

| Suite | Cases | Pass | Fail | Timeout | Skip | Pass rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| sv-tests | 1497 | 1066 | 430 | 1 | 0 | 71.2% |
| verilator | 2415 | 549 | 1567 | 3 | 296 | 25.9% |
| ivtest | 2826 | 1238 | 1559 | 4 | 25 | 44.2% |
| vests | 3665 | 1873 | 1790 | 2 | 0 | 51.1% |
| nvc | 1482 | 443 | 821 | 3 | 215 | 35.0% |
| vhdl-compliance | 72 | 16 | 56 | 0 | 0 | 22.2% |

VUnit test cases: 12 of 154 pass. Compared with run 4, 192 cases newly pass.
One newly fails: the sv-tests void-return negative case, fixed in batch 10.

### Batch 9: SystemVerilog class statements and string replication

- A class function method called as a statement (`c.set(5);`) or discarded
  with `void'()` lowers as a method call whose result is discarded. Void
  methods included. This was the most common failing statement in the
  Verilator corpus.
- A static class property reached through an object handle (`obj.count`)
  denotes the class's single storage (IEEE 1800-2017 8.9).
- String replication (`{3{"ab"}}`, IEEE 1800-2017 11.4.12.2).

Fixture: `sv_class_statements.sv`, checked against xsim.

### Batch 8: SystemVerilog function statements and procedural writers

- A void function called as a statement (`bump(2);`) and a discarded
  function result (`void'(f(x));`) failed to lower (IEEE 1800-2017 13.4.1).
  This affected about 100 corpus statements.
- A variable written by procedural statements in several processes, such as
  two `initial` blocks, was rejected with `FSIM-ELAB-DRV-001`. IEEE
  1800-2017 6.5 allows this; the last write determines the value.
  `FSIM-ELAB-DRV-001` now applies only to continuous assignments that
  conflict with other drivers, and to unresolved VHDL signals with several
  processes.

Fixture: `sv_function_statements.sv`, checked against xsim. A targeted rerun
of the run-4 `FSIM-ELAB-HIR-001` cases: 13 more pass. Most of these tests
also use other unsupported constructs.

### Batch 7: STRING generics, top-level overrides, VUnit stand-in

- STRING generics, with or without a default, bound by a generic map or a
  top-level override. Includes `'LENGTH` and the other array attributes of
  a STRING constant or generic, taken from its static value.
- `fsim elaborate --generic NAME=VALUE` overrides root generics: STRING,
  integer or BOOLEAN values, applied to every root that declares the generic.
  This is the corpus runner's hook for VUnit `runner_cfg` and nvc generics.
  New diagnostic: `FSIM-ELAB-GENERIC-009`.
- A protected type body may declare private subprograms that its
  declaration does not list (IEEE 1076-2008 5.6.3). `FSIM-ELAB-VHPROTECTED-003`
  and `-005` are retired.
- Procedure overload resolution distinguishes array types:
  `STD_(U)LOGIC_VECTOR`, `UNSIGNED`, `SIGNED`, `BIT_VECTOR` and user array
  types. Before, any two vectors of equal width matched every overload, and
  the call was reported as ambiguous.
- The VUnit stand-in (`scripts/lrm_corpus/vunit_shim.vhd`) keeps its state in
  a package shared variable and selects test cases by call order, without
  storing names. It reports failures without a test name; the runner
  attributes each failure to the most recently started test case.

VHDL-Compliance: 16 of 72 testbench files and 12 of 154 VUnit test cases
pass. Before this batch, none did.

Fixture: `vhdl_string_generics.vhd`, which uses the harness's new
`generic=NAME=VALUE` header key. It was checked against xsim (`xelab
-generic_top`).

### Corpus run 4 (after batches 4 and 5, interpreter)

| Suite | Cases | Pass | Fail | Timeout | Skip | Pass rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| sv-tests | 1497 | 1037 | 459 | 1 | 0 | 69.3% |
| verilator | 2415 | 435 | 1681 | 3 | 296 | 20.5% |
| ivtest | 2826 | 1229 | 1568 | 4 | 25 | 43.9% |
| vests | 3665 | 1854 | 1809 | 2 | 0 | 50.6% |
| nvc | 1482 | 439 | 825 | 3 | 215 | 34.6% |
| vhdl-compliance | 72 | 0 | 72 | 0 | 0 | 0.0% |

Compared with run 3, 245 cases newly pass and 53 newly fail:

- 50 are negative tests that had been rejected only by an unsupported form.
- 3 previously passed only because `$unit` typedefs were skipped:
  - a wildcard associative-array index (`[*]`);
  - a typedef adding packed dimensions to a user type;
  - a non-ANSI port whose type is declared before its direction.

UVM-based sv-tests now compile the whole UVM library before reaching
randomization, which makes the sv-tests suite much slower.

### Batch 6: package shared variables, typed files

- Shared variables declared in packages and package bodies (protected types,
  IEEE 1076-2008 4.7) are design-global objects. Each is materialized once
  and visible to every design unit through the package's subprograms. This
  unblocks the VUnit stand-in, whose state is a package shared variable.
- Direct VHDL file I/O handles files of integer and physical types of up to
  64 bits, and of two-state types: enumerations, BIT, BOOLEAN, REAL, and
  composites of those. Before, only integer files of up to 32 bits worked
  (86 VESTs cases failed with `FSIM-ELAB-VHFILE-011`).
  - An aggregate actual of `write` takes the file element type as context.
  - `endfile` is true after the last element is read.
- SystemVerilog package parameters whose default is a literal with X or Z
  digits (`parameter int foo = 1'bx;`) no longer fail with
  `FSIM-ELAB-SVPKG-006`.

Fixtures: `vhdl_package_shared_variables.vhd`, `vhdl_typed_files.vhd`. Both
were checked against xsim.

### Corpus run 3 (after batches 2 and 3, interpreter)

| Suite | Cases | Pass | Fail | Timeout | Skip | Pass rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| sv-tests | 1497 | 989 | 503 | 5 | 0 | 66.1% |
| verilator | 2415 | 426 | 1686 | 7 | 296 | 20.1% |
| ivtest | 2826 | 1211 | 1586 | 4 | 25 | 43.2% |
| vests | 3665 | 1745 | 1918 | 2 | 0 | 47.6% |
| nvc | 1482 | 424 | 840 | 3 | 215 | 33.5% |
| vhdl-compliance | 72 | 0 | 72 | 0 | 0 | 0.0% |

Compared with run 2, 93 cases newly pass. Three negative cases newly pass
analysis. They had been rejected only by the retired output-port-default
error, and each exposes an existing gap:

- VESTs tc112: reading a port of mode `out` before VHDL-2008.
- nvc issue885: the default of an output port as the driver's initial
  value.
- nvc force3: the length check on a forced value.
