# fsim v1 resume handoff

This is the short entry point for resuming v1 implementation. The
[implementation plan](implementation-plan.md) remains the chronological record,
and the [feature matrix](feature-matrix.md) remains the release authority.

## Snapshot

- Recorded: 2026-07-29.
- Branch: `codex/resumable-jit`.
- Implementation baseline: `18078f8` (`feat: add SystemVerilog parameter
  sizing semantics`).
- Baseline was synchronized with `origin/codex/resumable-jit`.
- The source-size refactor is complete: all 215 authored C/C++ source, header,
  and test files are at or below the 2,000-line hard limit; the allowlist is
  empty and the maximum is 1,998 lines.
- The exact LLVM 22.1.8 warnings-as-errors Debug regression passed all 42
  configured tests in 185.68 seconds, and Release passed all 43 configured
  tests in 51.73 seconds on 2026-07-29.
- No CI state was inspected during feature batch 48 or this handoff.

The repository is a substantial pre-alpha executable simulator, not fsim v1.
Many language families have strong bounded evidence, but every broad v1
contract row is release-blocking until it has complete positive, negative,
elaboration, interpreter, and JIT evidence.

## Progress by milestone

| Milestone | Status | Current result |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Platform and semantic spine | In progress | Cross-platform C++20/CMake foundation, exact LLVM adapter, dependencies, diagnostics, manifest, native ABIs, Tcl, and CI definitions exist. Unicode/path and remaining console-interrupt validation are open. |
| 2. Internal vertical slice | In progress, near architecture gate | Interpreter, hybrid LLVM JIT, cache, deterministic scheduler, mixed hierarchy, VCD, debugger, and examples execute. Declared integral SystemVerilog parameter conversion now has interpreter/O0/O2/cache evidence; VHDL interface-type generics, remaining SV sizing, source metadata, and complete differential coverage still block the gate. |
| 3. Near-full synthesizable frontends | Pending | Broad bounded VHDL and SV execution exists, but the explicit language-specific typed HIR/DesignIR layering and full promised language semantics are incomplete. |
| 4. Procedural testbenches, SystemC, visibility | In progress | Extensive procedural, SystemC, C API, debugger, Tcl, and trace slices execute. Dynamic testbench data, files, fork/event completeness, richer SystemC behavior, and remaining API metadata are open. |
| 5. Release hardening | In progress | Cache hardening, diagnostics, sanitizer/fuzz jobs, cross-platform workflows, install smoke tests, and normalized traces exist. Full platform closure, benchmarks, imported tests/packages, and all matrix rows remain open. |

## Implemented foundation

The following capabilities have executable evidence and should be extended,
not rebuilt:

- handwritten VHDL and Verilog/SystemVerilog preprocessing, parsing, semantic
  checks, source spans, macro ancestry, and stable diagnostics;
- a common elaborated hierarchy with stable instance, process, signal, driver,
  scope, source, and specialization identities;
- typed SimIR, a deterministic reference interpreter, and a single-thread
  active/inactive/update/postponed scheduler with delta-oscillation diagnosis;
- packed Bit2, Logic4, and exact Logic9 values, wide-value runtime kernels,
  process-owned drivers, standard resolution, delayed/projected transactions,
  NBA/update writes, dynamic packed indexing, and committed-change visibility;
- LLVM 22.1.8 ORC/LLJIT execution at O2 for `run` and O0 for `debug`, explicit
  resumable process frames, per-process fallback, specialization modules, and
  a persistent checksummed native-object cache;
- explicit recursive VHDL, Verilog/SystemVerilog, and SystemC hierarchy in
  every parent/child direction, including bounded immutable construction
  actuals and explicit boundary resolvers;
- VCD, CLI debugger, safe points, statement/process/delta/time stepping,
  breakpoints, locals, hierarchy navigation, deposit/force/release, callbacks,
  and Ctrl-C integration;
- the versioned native C API and SystemC plug-in ABI;
- the fsim SystemC facade, compiled support library, cached plug-in compiler,
  factories, hierarchy, ports/exports/signals/events, methods, Boost.Context
  threads/cthreads, lifecycle, waits, notifications, and channel updates;
- schema-1 project loading and `check`, `build`, `run`, `debug`, and `tcl`
  command paths; and
- interactive and batch Tcl 9.0.4 over the common project, runtime, debugger,
  trace, diagnostic, and callback model.

The detailed bounded language coverage is recorded in
[language support](language-support.md). Do not infer support beyond that
document merely because the parser accepts a related form.

## Remaining v1 release blockers

### 1. Close the architecture gate

- Complete VHDL-2008 generic type semantics.
- Complete remaining SystemVerilog unsigned-64, type/string parameter, and
  self-determined expression sizing rules beyond the declared integral
  parameter conversion slice.
- Retain source/debug metadata for every remaining executable construct.
- Make the semantic differential harness compare interpreter, O0, and O2
  final state, assertions, scheduling observations, failures, and normalized
  trace events for every supported semantic fixture.
- Extend mixed-language evidence to O0, assertion failures, broader trace
  behavior, and Windows LLVM 22.1.8.
- Finish remaining generated forms, including guarded VHDL blocks,
  noncanonical SV loop updates, nonintegral VHDL choices, and additional
  declarative/module items.

### 2. Establish the final semantic architecture

- Separate the compact common frontend representation into explicit typed
  VHDL HIR and SystemVerilog HIR.
- Make elaborated DesignIR specialization, constant evaluation, legality, and
  source/debug metadata explicit rather than relying on bounded frontend
  structures.
- Preserve dense stable IDs and native-cache identity through that migration.
- Keep the SimIR interpreter as the semantic oracle throughout the change.

### 3. Complete VHDL-2008 v1 scope

- Finish configurations; full libraries, packages/bodies, and contexts;
  generics; components/direct instantiation; blocks and generates.
- Finish name/overload resolution, constant evaluation, legality, resolution
  functions, complete synthesizable statements, and full promised composite
  type/aggregate/attribute behavior.
- Finish waits, assertions/reports, files, and TextIO.
- Close physical-time and inertial/transport/reject semantics beyond the
  implemented bounded forms.
- Review, license, bundle, and test the Apache-2.0 IEEE logic, numeric, bit,
  fixed, and floating-point packages.

### 4. Complete Verilog-2005/SystemVerilog-2017 v1 scope

- Finish directive semantics, parameters, generates, hierarchy, and
  specialization.
- Add interfaces/modports and complete packages.
- Complete packed/unpacked types, nested aggregates, memories, functions,
  tasks, all `always` forms, expressions, gates, and assignment semantics.
- Complete general delays/events, fork/join, named events, and NBA/delta
  matrices.
- Add strings, files, dynamic/associative arrays, queues, and `$readmem*`.

### 5. Complete mixed-language and SystemC semantics

- Finish general ascending/descending ordinal vector mapping and portable
  Boolean/integer boundary conversions.
- Close every state-domain, signedness, width, resolver, multi-driver,
  construction-parameter, delay, delta, and NBA direction matrix.
- Broaden SystemC named hierarchy, sensitivity/list/error coverage, port-chain
  policies, standard channel behavior, compiler/cache fingerprints, and
  Windows thread/plugin evidence.
- Complete remaining native API object kinds and richer canonical value
  metadata.

### 6. Release hardening

- Finish Windows Unicode path, Ctrl-C, DLL, plug-in compiler, and cache tests.
- Expand sanitizer and fuzz corpora through complete frontends and serialized
  SimIR.
- Add benchmark runners for cold/warm build, events per second, memory, wide
  values, resolution, crossings, trace overhead, and debug overhead.
- Import only license-reviewed external tests and preserve their notices.
- Pass every required feature-matrix row on Ubuntu/GCC and Windows/MSVC in
  Debug and Release, with LLVM 22.1.8 where required.

Python automation remains explicitly post-v1. It must later wrap the same
opaque native session/object model already used by Tcl.

## Next ten-feature batch

Resume with **feature batch 49: VHDL-2008 interface type generics**:

1. Parse interface type generic declarations and optional bounded defaults
   with retained source metadata.
2. Represent type-generic formals distinctly from scalar value generics.
3. Parse named and positional type-mark actuals without treating them as
   value expressions.
4. Resolve type actuals through the VHDL library/package/type namespace.
5. Introduce the smallest explicit semantic type environment needed by
   generic-dependent ports, objects, and subtype constraints.
6. Specialize generic-dependent packed, enumeration, record, and supported
   one-dimensional array types without mutating shared frontend declarations.
7. Canonicalize type actuals into specialization identity, DesignIR metadata,
   and native-cache keys.
8. Diagnose missing, duplicate, unknown, cyclic, incompatible, and
   cross-language-unrepresentable type actuals with stable codes.
9. Preserve source/debug metadata and require interpreter/O0/O2 behavior and
   failure equivalence for each supported dependent type family.
10. Add positive, negative, elaboration, runtime, mixed-hierarchy,
    cold/warm/invalidation, support-document, and feature-matrix evidence,
    then run and push the scheduled regression gate.

Keep this batch bounded. Do not encode semantic type state in parser nodes or
headers full of executable code; introduce independently compiled semantic
services where required by the typed-HIR migration.

## Working cadence

- Implement ten related features before the next full regression.
- Use focused warnings-as-errors builds and targeted tests after each coherent
  change; do not run the full suite for every individual feature.
- At the tenth feature, run the exact LLVM 22.1.8 Debug and Release regression
  appropriate to the batch, update the plan/support/matrix documents, commit,
  and push the branch.
- Do not inspect GitHub Actions runs unless explicitly requested.
- Preserve the 2,000-line hard limit, prefer approximately 1,600 lines, split
  compilation units by responsibility, and do not move executable
  implementation into `_internal.hpp` files.
- Keep Windows portability in every implementation decision: use secure CRT
  or compatibility wrappers for environment access, avoid POSIX-only path and
  process assumptions, keep the native ABI plain C, and test MSVC/clang-cl
  behavior in the scheduled platform gate.

## Resume commands

Start by confirming that no newer implementation supersedes this handoff:

```sh
git status --short --branch
git log -5 --oneline --decorate
```

The existing exact-LLVM build trees on the recorded development host are:

```sh
cmake --build build/llvm22-ninja-debug --parallel 8
cmake --build build/llvm22-ninja-release --parallel 8
```

Use a narrow test expression while batch 49 is in progress, for example:

```sh
ctest --test-dir build/llvm22-ninja-debug --output-on-failure \
  -R 'fsim\.(frontend|elaboration|llvm|application|source-line-budget)'
```

Both exact-LLVM build trees were rebuilt for feature batch 48. The configured
test counts differ because the Release tree includes the fetched-Tcl
relocation test; both recorded inventories are clean.

For a fresh checkout, configure exact LLVM explicitly:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build/llvm22-ninja-debug -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
  -DFSIM_BUILD_TESTS=ON \
  -DFSIM_LLVM_MODE=ON \
  -DFSIM_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=ON \
  -DLLVM_DIR=/usr/lib/llvm-22/lib/cmake/llvm
```

Before declaring any row complete, consult:

- [implementation plan and progress](implementation-plan.md);
- [feature matrix and release evidence](feature-matrix.md);
- [language support](language-support.md);
- [cross-language semantic contract](cross-language-semantics.md); and
- [SystemC subset and plug-in model](systemc-subset.md).
